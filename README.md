Below is a website I made using the above code as a platform. 

Abodemart aims at creating a hassle free platform for college students looking to buy and sell furniture, electronics, books, vehicles and a lot more.

If you are looking for a specific item to buy, With Abodemart there is no intermediary, get in touch directly with the seller! Moving in and out, now made easy!
